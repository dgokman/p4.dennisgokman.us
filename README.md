Final Project

Mad Libs are a classic game played by people of all ages where one person asks another to name a bunch of words, specifying noun, verb, person, etc. They then insert them into a pre-written story with blank spaces and hilarity ensues. My app, called Good Kid MAAD Libs, is a version of this game, without the need for a person, pencil, or paper. Simply, you enter the specified words into the form, and a story of varying humor gets spit out for you.

App features:
- Use of SQL database to collect words, query them, and delete them when finished
- PHP insertion into pre-written stories 
- Usage of AJAX to create a link to several stories after submitting form


Javascript features:
- AJAX links appearing after form is completed
- Form verification to make sure all fields are entered
